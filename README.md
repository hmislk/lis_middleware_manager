## Overview

LIS Middleware Manager is a PyQt6 desktop application that lets you run, monitor, and manage multiple Java JAR middleware services from a single interface. It provides real-time log streaming, automatic crash recovery, role-based access control, and secure user authentication - all wrapped in a clean dark-themed UI.

## Features

### Process Management
- **Add multiple JAR services** - browse and register any number of Java JAR files
- **Start / Stop individual services** - with confirmation prompts to prevent accidents
- **Start All / Stop All** - control all services in one click
- **Auto-restart on crash** - crashed services automatically restart after 3 seconds
- **Full process tree termination** - uses `taskkill /T` on Windows to kill child JVM processes, ensuring no background Java processes are left behind

### Log Viewer
- **Real-time streaming** - stdout and stderr displayed live as the process runs
- **Per-service log panel** - click any service in the sidebar to view its logs
- **Persistent log files** - logs saved to `middlewere_logs/<service-name>.log`
- **Colour-coded output** - normal output in white, errors in orange, system messages in colour

### Authentication & Security
- **Secure login screen** - shown on every launch
- **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** password hashing with a unique 32-byte random salt per user (260,000 iterations - OWASP 2023 standard)
- **Timing-safe comparison** - uses `secrets.compare_digest` to prevent timing attacks
- **Passwords never stored** - only the hash and salt are saved to disk

### Role-Based Access Control

| Feature | Admin | General |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| View services & logs | ✅ | ✅ |
| Start / Stop services | ✅ | ✅ |
| Add JAR service | ✅ | ❌ |
| Remove service | ✅ | ❌ |
| Clear logs | ✅ | ❌ |
| Change password | ✅ | ❌ |
| Manage users | ✅ | ❌ |
| Reset other users' passwords | ✅ | ❌ |

### User Management *(Admin only)*
- **Add users** - create new Admin or General accounts
- **Remove users** - delete any account except your own
- **Reset passwords** - reset any user's password without knowing the old one
- **User list** - view all registered users with their roles
- **Multi-user support** - unlimited users stored in a single JSON file

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|---|---|
| UI Framework | PyQt6 |
| Language | Python 3.10+ |
| Process Management | QProcess + subprocess (taskkill) |
| Password Hashing | hashlib PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 |
| Credential Storage | JSON (`~/.middleware_manager/auth.json`) |
| Service Config | JSON (`~/.middleware_manager/config.json`) |
| Runtime | Java (JRE required for JAR execution) |

## Requirements

- Python **3.10** or higher
- Java **JRE/JDK** installed and on `PATH`
- Windows 10 / 11

---

## Installation

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/damithdeshan98/lis_middleware_manager.git
cd lis_middleware_manager
```

**2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**3. Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Run the application**

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## First Launch

On first run, a **Create Account** screen is shown. The first account is always created as **Administrator**.

```
Username  →  choose any username
Password  →  minimum 6 characters
Role      →  Admin (locked for first account)
```

After setup, the login screen appears on every subsequent launch.

> To reset all users (e.g. forgotten password), delete `~/.middleware_manager/auth.json` — the app will show the Create Account screen on next launch.

## Data Storage

All data is stored **outside the project directory** and is never committed to version control.

| File | Location | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| User credentials | `~/.middleware_manager/auth.json` | Usernames, hashed passwords, roles |
| Service config | `~/.middleware_manager/config.json` | Registered JAR paths and names |
| Log files | `<project>/middlewere_logs/` | Per-service runtime logs |

---

## Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed using **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** with 260,000 iterations
- A unique **32-byte cryptographic salt** is generated per user via `secrets.token_bytes`
- Login uses **`secrets.compare_digest`** to prevent timing side-channel attacks
- Credential files are stored in the user's home directory, outside the project and git repository
